### Background
In interest of improving my programming skills and learn more about Rust, I've decided to run through all of the official (?) documentation published on the community site. 

The Rust Language and Rust by Example offer examples for the majority of the features/syntactical nuances - this repository is my spin on each of the examples. In the interest of learning and not just copying the examples verbatim, I put my own spin on the programs in each section. For the larger 'project' examples in these books, I try to integrate content from other chapters to improve/expand upon the original. 

At some point, I intend I reorganizing this repository and contributing to the documentation.
